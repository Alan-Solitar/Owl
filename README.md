### Firefox add-on for comfortable reading


An add-on to make online reading easy.

If you're like me, you too would be spending a LOT of your time glued to your computer screen. And I'm pretty sure you can feel those glaring webpage themes burn your eyes every time to look at them. Fret no more, Owl is here to rescue. This add-on "turns the lights off" i.e. it transforms the appearance of the webpage into a darker theme (Darkula like theme), thus making the webpage easy on the eyes.


## Demo

A regular wikipedia page:

Same page with Owl enabled:

## Contribute
Current version (v1.3.2) has the most of the functionality I intended to have for this add-on. A few upcoming features would be:
- Export / Import settings
- Sync across Firefox profiles (once the WebExtensions API supports it, which should be soon)
Currently, the add-on is being port from the lagacy Add-on SDK to the newer WebExtensions API. The development branch is `v2` in case you wish to help with the port.
