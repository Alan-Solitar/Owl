### Firefox add-on for comfortable reading


An add-on to make online reading easy.

If you're like me, you too would be spending a LOT of your time glued to your computer screen. And I'm pretty sure you can feel those glaring webpage themes burn your eyes every time to look at them. Fret no more, Owl is here to rescue. This add-on "turns the lights off" i.e. it transforms the appearance of the webpage into a darker theme (Darkula like theme), thus making the webpage easy on the eyes.


## Demo

A regular wikipedia page:

Same page with Owl enabled:
