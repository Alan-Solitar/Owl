#Owl Add-on
An add-on to make online reading easy.
If you're like me, you too would be spending a LOT of your time glued to your computer screen. And I'm pretty sure you can feel those glaring webpage themes burn your eyes every time to look at them. Fret not, Owl is here to rescue. This add-on "turns the lights off", i.e. it transforms the appearance of the webpage into a darker theme (Darkula theme, if you know it), thus making the webpage easy on the eyes.

##Install
To install this add-on in firefox ()version 34.0 and above), simple download the @owl-addon-1.0.0.xpi file in this repo and drag-drop into firefox. It'll be installed automatically, without any need of restart. 
Enjoy!
