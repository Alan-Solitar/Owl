                    <br> Thanks for choosing Owl.
                    <br> I started Owl 2 years ago as a quick side project to help save my eyes from those bright-white webpages.
                    <br>I never thought it would catch on so well, and it's unexpected popularity encouraged me to keep improving it
                    till it was the best "dark background" solution out there. 
                    <br>But as much as I have enjoyed maintaining and upgrading Owl to fit everyone's needs, it's getting increasingly hard for me to
                    keep Owl up-to-date with the people's needs. And that is the reason I want to invite my fellow developers out there to contribute to the 
                    add-on we all love.

        <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-push-1">
            <div class="panel panel-success">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Code contributions</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-left" style="font-size: 0.825em;padding-left: 30px;">
                    Owl is completely open source and its source if freely available on Github. <br>
                    The next milestone I aim to deliver is Owl v3. Based on inputs from the users and some realizations on my side, 
                    I hace sketched a basic outline of what the next version would like. Features like smarter CSS application, better URL filtering,
                    red-light shift mode and a new 'High Contrast' theme are on the list. Over that, I would also appreciate suggestions from other devs out there
                    on how Owl can be improved in terms of features and performance. 
                    <br>
                    If you're a developer and would like to help me build the next version of Owl, head up to the <a href="https://github.com/tigerkid001/owl/issues">Github Issues</a> page and 
                    and contribute in whatever way you like (suggestions, code). Look for issues tagged with <a href="https://github.com/TigerKid001/Owl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">
                    "Help Wanted"</a> or with <a href="https://github.com/TigerKid001/Owl/milestone/1">milestone v3</a>. Check <a href="https://github.com/TigerKid001/Owl/issues/21">this tracker bug</a> for a general list of the targets for v3. 
                    
                    I'll be looking forward to discussions and pull requests. See you there :)
